## Personal

Hello, my name is Bode Asamoto and I am a fourth year student majoring in marketing
and management information systems from Honolulu, Hawaii. I decided to major in MIS 
because I took Business 311 last semester with Professor Aurigemma and thoroughly 
enjoyed the class.

Academic

I graduated from Kalani High school in 2020 and since then I have changed my major
quite a few times. I am currently scheduled to graduate from the University of Hawaii at 
Manoa in the Fall of 2024 with my B.B.A in marketing and MIS. After that I hope to get a 
graduate assistantship and work towards a masters degree in either marketing or MIS.

Extracurricular activities

I currently work at two different jobs, I work part time as a shift manager at a Taco Bell
and intern part time as a recruiting and general office assistant with the Universities
football team. Additionally, I am also a member of Delta Sigma Pi, the only professional
business fraternity at UH Manoa.
